#Regarding Vault as it happens Ryan was looking at this recently. 
#This would all be done in Terraform using the Vault provider to pull keys/tokens from vault and then pass them to the Google provider. This example shows how it is done for AWS but the principle is the same for Google.

terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    hostname = "my.scalr.com"
    organization = "your-org"

    workspaces {
      name = "your-workspace"
    }
  }
}

provider "vault" {
 address = "var.address"
 token = "var.token"
}

data "vault_aws_access_credentials" "creds" {
  backend = "aws"
  role    = "my-role"
}

provider "aws" {
  access_key = data.vault_aws_access_credentials.creds.access_key
  secret_key = data.vault_aws_access_credentials.creds.secret_key
  region  = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "scalr" {
  ami                    = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type          = "t2.nano"
