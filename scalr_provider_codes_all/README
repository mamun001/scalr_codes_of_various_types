notes from provider version rc3 : no longer applicable

format of the configs is very picky:

error message is awlays the same: unprocessable entity

  cause: 1. bad vcs code
         2. wrong repo link
         3. foobar workspace already existed. 

correct:

vcs_repo {
      identifier = "foobarles/sandbox/mamun-sandbox/foobarrepo"
      oauth_token_id = "vcs-srphlef0tva8j8o"
      }
